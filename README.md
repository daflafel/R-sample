# R-sample
Data analysis examples where I used R to conduct quantitative analysis and research methods in political science, international relations, and conflict analysis. I used concepts and tools of descriptive and inferential statistics to complete these exercises.

Predictions sample include examples of scatter plots, simple linear regression, least squares, regression toward the mean, multivariate linear regression, and model fit. There is an RMD file that can be run in R as well as an html file that can be downloaded.

Loops sample includes examples of using loops to find averages for 50 different subcategories in data. It also includes scatterplots.
